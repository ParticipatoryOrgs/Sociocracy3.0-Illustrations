# s3-illustrations

A package with illustrations for Sociocracy 3.0 Patterns.

This package contains many the illustrations I have created for Sociocracy 3.0 (a.k.a. S3). 

For the moment, the illustrations are available as png files with 140dpi, both with white and transparent backgrounds, in English and German versions.


## Translation:



## Scripts:

`extract-strings.sh` extracts all translatable strings from source files into pot-files. 

`upload-translations.sh` uploads the pot-files to crowdin

`export-en.sh` exports the English illustrations to png files with 140dpi, with and without transparent background.

These scripts rely on OmniGraffle and a set of [commandline tools](https://github.com/bboc/omnigraffle-export), both of which are currently only available on OS-X.
