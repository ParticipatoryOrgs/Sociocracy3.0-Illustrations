# The Sociocracy 3.0 Illustration Repository

This package contains 130 illustrations for Sociocracy 3.0 (a.k.a. S3), created for S3 resources like "S3 - A Practical Guide" and the S3 website.

For the moment, the illustrations are available as png files with 140dpi, both with white and transparent backgrounds, in English and German versions.

Go to the [project's GitHub page](https://illustrations.sociocracy30.org) to download or browse the illustrations.


## Translation:

If you want to contribute to translating the illustrations into your language, please vistit <https://sociocracy30.org/translations/> 

## Scripts:

`extract-strings.sh` extracts all translatable strings from source files into pot-files. 

`upload-translations.sh` uploads the pot-files to crowdin

`export-en.sh` exports the English illustrations to png files with 140dpi, with and without transparent background.

These scripts rely on OmniGraffle and a set of [commandline tools](https://github.com/bboc/omnigraffle-export), both of which are currently only available on OS-X.
