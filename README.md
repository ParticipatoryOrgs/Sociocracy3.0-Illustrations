# s3-illustrations

A package with illustrations for Sociocracy 3.0 Patterns.

This package contains many the illustrations I have created for Sociocracy 3.0 (a.k.a. S3). 

For the moment, the illustrations are available as png files with 140dpi, both with white and transparent backgrounds, in English and German versions.
